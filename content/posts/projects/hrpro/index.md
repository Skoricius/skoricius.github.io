During the summer of 2014, I worked for [HrPro](https://hrpro.hr/), one of the leading Human Resourse software companies in Croatia. 

As an intern, I helped build a graphical interface for representing the organizational structure of companies. Additionally, I worked on a method for optimizing the placement of about 10,000 workers in stores throught the country for [Konzum](https://www.konzum.hr/), the Croatia's biggest chains of supermarkets. I implemented [the Hungarian method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm) in C# to minimize the overall transport costs of employees to the stores they work in.
