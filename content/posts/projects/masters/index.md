My Masters Project for BSci in Physics was on <b>"Electrically contacting nanocrystals using a selectively etched nanogap"</b>. I measured the electrical conductivity of a device where a  nanoparticles served as the contact between conductors. Due to the small size of nanoparticles, we get an effect known as [Coulomb blockade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb_blockade). This results in the device no longer following Ohm's resistance law and instead has staricase-like resistance (see Figure below). The Coulomb blockade could be used to build [single-electron transistors (SET)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-electron_transistor) for low-power computation and highly sensitive sensors.

In this project, I learned about electrical measurements, working with cryogenic temperatures, and data analysis. Most importantly, it made me interested in doing research in the area of Nanotechnology.
