I started working for
[Riverlane](https://riverlane.com/) in September 2021. We work on making quantum computing useful
sooner by developing a Quantum Error Correction stack.


Quantum Computers are very sensitive systems and it is
unavoidable that they constantly make errors. Therefore, to make
them practically useful, we need systems that
correct those errors. These are crucial to making useful quantum
computers scalable and practically useful. In Riverlane, I am a
part of the Logic team that works on solving these problems by
building a **Quantum Error Correction stack** .
