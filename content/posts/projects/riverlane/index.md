I started working for
[Riverlane](https://riverlane.com/), a quantum
engineering company. We work on making quantum computing useful
sooner by developing an operating system Deltaflow.OS to help
quantum hardware companies scale faster, reduce errors and
implement practical quantum error correction.

Quantum Computers are very sensitive systems and it is
unavoidable that they constantly make errors. Therefore, to make
them practically useful, we need to have benchmarking systems
which characterise the errors in the system, and systems that
correct those errors. These are crucial to making useful quantum
computers scalable and practically useful. In Riverlane, I am a
part of the Decode team that works on solving these problems by
building **Quantum Error Correction (QEC)** and
**Benchmarking** systems.
