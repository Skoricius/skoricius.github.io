To make Quantum Error Correction useful, we need a low-latency and high-throughput decoders tightly integrated with the control of a Quantum Computer. In our recent work, we demonstrate such a system on a scalable architecture and measure its throughput and latency. This work makes an important step, and gathers a lot of useful data towards building a fault-tolerant full-stack Quantum Computer
