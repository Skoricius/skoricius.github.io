At Riverlane, we are working on making scalable QEC stack. At its centre the stack needs an efficient and fast decoder that can efficiently scale up to thousands of qubits while maintaining the high data throughput. In our recent paper, we present Collision Clustering - a decoding algorithm implemented in both field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) hardware and demonstrate the required speed and scalability.
