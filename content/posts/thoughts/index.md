# My Life Philosophy

## Society (need to work through)

* Every institution needs to have a feedback mechanism for incentivising good work and making good decisions. Without it, the goal of optimizations is not clear (repharase)
* The current voting system is one of the major issues in current democracy. One vote per person without a good way to express preference inevitably leads to polarisation and [the tyranny of the majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority#Concurrent_majority). Preferential voting and localism are imperfect ways of dealing with this issue and only somewhat reduce its effect. A much better way of dealing with this is quadratic voting, with a good introduction written by [Vitalik Buterin](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html). I am a proponent of introducing quadratic voting wherever possible to be able to express the level of agreement and finding the intermediate option which everybody is equally happy (or unhappy with).
* The key to making a successful society is to have a good goal alignment - the same problem that arises in AI safety. Ergo quadratic voting. This determines the [final goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence#Instrumental_and_final_goals). This is something we still have not agreed on - what is it that we are trying to achieve with the society?
* Once there is a goal alignment, the key thing is to set up the incentives in such a way to make working towards the common goal. This system needs to have strong error correction mechanisms because we are inevitably going to find loopholes as we go.
* Need to read in more detail the [original paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2003531)
* The (main) final goal of the society should be preservation of life. There can be multiple final goals as multiple orthogonal directions can be optimized independently.
* For preservation of life, existance of an intelligent species like humans is paramount.
* The distinction between "is" and "should" questions. I think in modern society, we came to rely on science to answer all of our questions. However, science can only answer "is" questions. I.e. if we do this, then these are the consequences. But we rarely openly discuss "should" questions. I.e. what should we do with that information, what are our values and how do we live by them. These questions don't have a correct answer and they only depend on what you define to be the set of your final goals. This is where philosophy starts playing the key role.
* We as a society have to get away from the notion of certainties - that's just not how the world (quantum) works. We need to be comfortable with probabilities and think in the terms of degrees of belief - ergo Bayesian statistic. 
* All of the above makes me believe that to make progress in society, we need to heavily invest in education and in particular in better representation of several key areas: statistics and logical fallacies, philosophy and history of philosophical ideas, understanding of cause-effect, statistical significance and correlations vs causation


## Meaning fo life

* Meaning or purpose of life is the wrong question to ask. When you start examining what these words actually mean and what kind of answer would be satisfactory, you realize that this question does not make sense. Just because we can form a question does not mean it actually has a meaning or a good answer. In my opinion, meaning is in the sense "What is the meaning of a word?" i.e. how this word relates to the reality and objects in it. So "meaning of life" doesn't really make sense. Similarly "purpose" is what we want to use something for. Life and us are not a tool like a hammer. The purpose of a hammer is to nail down nails. In that sense, the question of the purpose of life would only make sense if there was another being/God that is using us to an end. But I do not believe this to be the case.
* The correct question should be what are the ultimate goals which we should pursue and if there is any way we can derive them from some higher principle?
