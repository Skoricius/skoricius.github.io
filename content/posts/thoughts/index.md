# My Life Philosophy

## Society

* Every institution needs to have a feedback mechanism for incentivising good work and making good decisions. Without it, the goal of optimizations is not clear (repharase)
* The current voting system is one of the major issues in current democracy. One vote per person without a good way to express preference inevitably leads to polarisation and [the tyranny of the majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority#Concurrent_majority). Preferential voting and localism are imperfect ways of dealing with this issue and only somewhat reduce its effect. A much better way of dealing with this is quadratic voting, with a good introduction written by [Vitalik Buterin](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html). I am a proponent of introducing quadratic voting wherever possible to be able to express the level of agreement and finding the intermediate option which everybody is equally happy (or unhappy with).
