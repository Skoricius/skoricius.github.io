## What is the meaning of life?

When posed by a question I am having difficulty answering, I like to start by focusing on fully understanding the question before giving the answer. And in this case, I believe that the meaning or purpose of life is the wrong question to ask. When you start examining what these words actually mean and what kind of answer would be satisfactory, you realize that this question does not necessarily make sense. At least not in a way that we would usually think.

If I asked you what do you mean by meaning in the question *"What is the meaning of life?"*, what would you say? 
Just because we can form a question does not mean it actually has a meaning or a good answer. An example would be a question like *"What colour does coffee smell like?"*. Somebody with synesthesia might claim to have an answer to this, but there is no objective way to answer this question because *smell* does not have a property of *colour*.

Meaning of life is a question like that. The word meaning means **the thing that is conveyed, especially by the language**. This would be in the sense *"What is the meaning of a word?"* i.e. how does this word relate to the reality and objects in it. So *"meaning of life"* doesn't really make sense. There is nothing we are trying to communicate or explain with life, so it does not have a property of meaning.

Another way to form this question is *"What is the purpose of life?"*. Similarly to the "meaning", the word "purpose" here would convey something different than what the asker might have intended. Purpose is **something set up as an object or an end to be attained**.
People's lives are not a tool like a hammer. The purpose of a hammer is to nail down nails. In that sense, the question of the purpose of life would only make sense if there was another being/God that is using us to an end. But I do not believe this to be the case. And if there is no God, then we are nobody's tools, and we don't have a purpose. That might sound bad when you first read it, but I am not advocating religion -- I am not keen on being anyone's tool just so I could give an answer to a semi-meaningless question.

The correct question that I believe most people want to answer is what ought to be our ultimate goals? And is there a higher principle from which these can be derived?
The short answer to this is no. This stems from the [**Hume's law**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem) (also known and the is-ought problem) that says that no ought statements (e.g. I should do this) can be deduced from is statements (e.g. Sky is blue. People have evolved from apelike ancestors.). So no amount of our knowledge of the world can help us deduce what ought we to be doing with our lives. Therefore, we need at least one ought statement that we start with to start deducing the other ones.
E.g. if we agree that I ought to try to preserve my life (on no basis whatsoever). Then we can deduce that I **ought** to avoid dancing on a highway because there **are** fast driving cars that **are** likely going to hit me. Using similar reasoning, we can deduce a lot about what I ought to do using our predictive knowledge.

The next question is then what ought to be our base ought statement. This question is circular and no good argument can be made to justify why one ultimate goal is better than the other because evaluating what *better* means can only be done in relation to some set of moral principles that stem from the ultimate goal itself.

Therefore, without much justification, I will propose one base ought statement that makes sense to me: **preservation of life**. This does not necessarily mean preservation of individuals, but preservation of a biosphere. Personally, this was the highest principle that I could think of. Because Universe with life that can observe and appreciate it is infinitely better than the Universe without it.
