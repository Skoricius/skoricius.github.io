*"If a man will begin with certainties, he shell end in doubts; but if he will be content to begin in doubts, he shall end in certainties"* 

**-- Francis Bacon**



With this section of short articles, I have decided to put down some of my thoughts on life, society and the future of world. 
The recent events in my life have urged me to write this down and to have a more widely accessible record of who I am as a person and what I find important.

A lot of the ideas here, of course, are not purely mine, but are heavily influenced by perhaps more original authors that I have come across and that have resonated with me, filtered through the lens of my own experiences. I will attempt to quote the source when I know it, but will almost certainly miss a large number of influences. The goal is not to make it academically accurate, but for me to systematize my life philosophy.
One of the skills that have served me well through life is the ability to identify and focus on the important and not to dwell on the vastness of noise that is out there. Here, I will attempt to use this to outline what I believe are some of the key ideas to making sense and navigating life.

As for the reader, of which I don't expect to be many, I hope that you will approach this text open minded. I take as one of the most important signs of intelligence to be able to consider and internalize ideas that are opposed to yours before dismissing them.
So please, chew on them for a bit, and then throw them out if you have a valid argument against them. In the latter case, I am interested in feedback and my contact details are available on the [homepage]({{< ref "/" >}} ).
